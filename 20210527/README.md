# Vue.js 2021 Spring Edition
We are back after a long Corona-inflicted break! Sadly we still could not host you in the cozy Celtra offices but we promise we will make it up to you once things get back to normal.
We had 2 speakers lined up again and a healthy crowd waiting for kickoff on zoom.

Žiga Miklič shared the mistakes he made during his Vue.js development and the lessons he learned. He nicely concluded with an evaluation if Vue was a good choice for a medium-scale enterprise application he worked on.

Matic Tribušon showed some examples of code degradation and together we tried to figure out how to fix and avoid this.

In case you missed the meetup or would just like to relive it, the video is available [here](https://vimeo.com/557607800/f954d57e88).
