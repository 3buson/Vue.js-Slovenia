# Vue.js 2019 Kick-Off
The first Vue.js meetup of 2019 took place on 4th of April in Celtra's offices.
We had 2 speakers and to spice things up a bit, we tried a completely new approach with one of the speakers being remote. This brought almost 90 people to Celtra's Ljubljana office.

Vladimir talked about [Hasura](https://hasura.io/vue-graphql), a free and open source GraphQL Engine that can help supercharge your GraphQL adoption. He provided various examples with live coding on how to leverage Hasura and use it with Vue.js
All the materials are available [here](http://slides.com/vladimirnovick/vuejs-hasura).

Matjaž showed us how Vue.js looks like through the eyes of an older programmer mostly programming desktop and back-office apps. He pointed out some examples of unexpected behaviour and we took a dive under the hood of Vue.js.
Matjaž's slides are available [here](http://mnet.si/vue_p/).

In case you missed the meetup or would just like to relive it, the video is available [here](https://vimeo.com/334933369) (apologies for a poorer quality this time).
