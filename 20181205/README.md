# Vue.js 2018 Get Together
The first and last Vue.js meetup of 2018 took place on 12th of December in Celtra's offices.
We had 2 speakers, David and Mato and around 80 attendees.

David talked about good practices and setups with essential plugins for rapid website development, based on NuxtJS and real-life experiences.
Mato shared with us a war story on how they pissed off a member of parliament by blindly trusting internal browser implementations.

In case you missed the meetup or would just like to relive it, the video is available [here](https://vimeo.com/305531085/cb7f0dd93d).
